#' Import data from tsv file
#' @description This function is mandatory to use the functions provided in this package. 
#' It will allow you to process the original tsv file and copy the data in 
#' different 'data.table' to be then analysed by specific functions. Within this 
#' function, the functions from biovolume and relative abundance are used to add 
#' these parameters in new columns to the tables
#' @param file one or several .tsv file(s) from a Planktoscope aquisition classified 
#' with Ecotaxa. If multiple files are inserted, make sure they are grouped in a list.
#' @param volumes If true, the functions ellipsoid.vol and biovolume will be 
#' called to add two additional columns to the returned data table object.info
#' containing the volume, calculated based on the ellipsoid approximation and 
#' biovolume of each object
#' @param unwanted a vector or list of strings containing the names of the categories 
#' you wish to discard. The function will search for these keywords in the field
#' object_annotation_hierarchy, therefore you can target large categories that include
#' several species. For example if category A contains categories a,b and c, and 
#' you want to omit a,b and c you can simply put A as argument. By default, the 
#' function will keep all categories.
#' @return the result is a list of four data tables. $for.veg to be used by the 
#' vegan package, sample in rows and categories in columns, the entries being 
#' the count of objects being in the corresponding sample and category. $object.info 
#' contains all objects (rows) and their specifications (eg size, color...). $sample.info
#' contains all samples (rows) and their specifications (eg speed, volume filtered, 
#' concentration factor). $counts is the summary of the absolute and relative 
#' abundances of categories in each sample.
